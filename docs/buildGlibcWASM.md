# Building glibc to WASM

I'd recommend reading this doc in its entirety before trying to compile.

## Prerequisites

You need to have an access to the server, ask somebody to help you. Then you pull an image to docker and run it

```
docker pull ubuntu:22.04
docker run -it ubuntu
```

We need glibc from lind-wasm, if you did it already then ignore it
[https://github.com/Lind-Project/lind-wasm.git](https://github.com/Lind-Project/lind-wasm.git)

We need WASM compatible `clang` and `ar`, which can be built locally from `wasi-sdk`
[https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk)

Also strongly recommend to install `wasm-objdump` from the `wabt` toolkit
[https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)

if you want to download files from github to server use `git clone` and `recurse-submodules`deal with repositories that contain submodules
```
git clone --recurse-submodules
```

If any error said "permission denied" then just add "sudo" at the front of the command line.

If you want to edit file through terminal, try to search vim and study how to use it.

## Configure

First we should install some apt essential

```
apt install build-essential
```

Second we need to compile wasm-sdk. Before this we need to access to wasm-sdk, you need to replace `cd wasi-sdk` to what your need 

```
cd wasi-sdk
NINJA_FLAGS=-v make -j8 package
```

-j8 means we are using 8 core, you can change the number. But normally 8 core is enough.

if terimal tells you, you don't have "make" or thing like that just use "apt-get install...". This is an example

```
apt-get install make
```

Third switch branch which is related with github(cd to lind-wasm/glicb). Find out which branch you are on currently and switch to branch "main" 

```
git branch -a
git switch main 
```

For step four, we create a .sh file and write a config script in the file. We use `nano` to create file in the glibc root directory(glibc is in the lind-wasm directory) and you can change `anyname` into the filename you want

```
nano anyname.sh
```
before writing the script we need to install gcc-i686

```
apt install gcc-i686-linux-gnu g++-i686-linux-gnu
```

then we write the script like this

```
#!/bin/bash
set -e
BUILDDIR=build
mkdir -p $BUILDDIR
cd $BUILDDIR
../configure --disable-werror --disable-hidden-plt --with-headers=/usr/i686-linux-gnu/include --prefix=/home/lind-wasm/glibc/target --host=i686-linux-gnu --build=i686-linux-gnu\
    CFLAGS=" -O2 -g" \
    CC="/home/wasi-sdk/build/llvm/bin/clang-18 --target=wasm32-unkown-wasi -v -Wno-int-conversion"
```

You should replace `CC` to the path to your `clang`, this path should work but if not change this part (/home/wasi-sdk/build/llvm/bin/clang-18) into your own path. If you define `BUILDDIR=build`, then the compiled WASM object files will appear under `glibc/build`.
Be aware that you should make sure this build directory is empty before running config script, so you need to `rm -rf build` before recompiling it.

A crutial job of the configure script is deciding which sysdeps directories to use according to the `host` and `build` string.
We already changed the configure script in glibc root directory, and the lind add-on directories are already baked to be included.

The configure flags we need:

- `disable-werror`: we have countless warnings, so we ignore them for now
- `disable-hidden-plt`: PLT bypassing optimization is causing ~50k errors, simply disable it for now
- `with-headers`: glibc requires Linux kernel headers to be installed before config and compile, so set this flag to a built-in sysroot of 32bit, this doesn't seem to raise an issue for our WASM built
- `prefix=`: this is the path of the generated sysroot when you use `make install`. But note that, the glibc's `make install` will NOT work at all for WASM, because WASM sysroot has differen structure convention, also requires an `llvm-ar` arhive. More details, see my script `gen_sysroot.sh`. However, we can still use `make install` just to generate the `.h` files of the sysroot
- `host` & `target`: we start off from the sysdeps direcotries of i686, so fixing these options

The compiler flags we need:

- `-O2 -g`: nah the glibc won't allow you to compile with `O0`, so we bear with this `O2` optimization during debugging. But sometimes you can change to `O1`.
-  `-Wno-int-conversion`: we disable int conversion warnings, cuz all 32bit types as WASM function arguments, are eventually i32 anyway
- `--target=wasm32-unkown-wasi`: this tells the compiler we want to compile to WASM

Now the last step is to run the .sh file
```
sudo chmod +x anyname.sh 
./anyname.sh
```

After config succeed, you will see these in the `build` directory,
```
Makefile  bits  config.h  config.log  config.make  config.status
```
## installing glibc
Before we start compiling to object files we need to install the glibc we complied to the prefix in the .sh file. For example, mine will install into "target". This is the install command line we need to use
```
make install --keep-going
```

## Compiling to object files

In the build directory, usually we use `make --keep-going -j$(nproc)`. The first flag is to continue compiling after errors, we need this cuz there are too many errors now (mainly due to assembly about threading). The `-j` is important to speed it up, but also makes the compilation log interleaved. The compilation log is **VERY IMPORTANT**, which tells why a given c file failed to be compiled. So sometimes we don't want the `-j`. Also, we can copy the actual compiler command in the compile log. For such commands, if we want to compile a single C file, only the source file path need to be further specified. We can use this to test compiling a specific file.

## Generating WASM sysroot
This procedure is specified in the `gen_sysroot.sh` script in our glibc repo. It's main job is to generate a WASM sysroot structure like

```
sysroot/
- include/
  - wasm32-wasi/
    - stdio.h
    - ...other headers
- lib/
  - wasm32-wasi/
    - crt1.o
    - libc.a
```
This is the code for `gen_sysroot.sh`
```
#!/bin/bash

# Define the source directory for object files (change ./build to your desired path)
src_dir="./build"

# Define paths for copying additional resources
include_source_dir="/home/lind-wasm/glibc/target/include"
crt1_source_path="/home/lind-wasm/glibc/lind_syscall/crt1.o"
lind_syscall_path="/home/lind-wasm/glibc/lind_syscall/lind_syscall.o" # Path to the lind_syscall.o file

# Define the output archive and sysroot directory
output_archive="sysroot/lib/wasm32-wasi/libc.a"
sysroot_dir="sysroot"

# First, remove the existing sysroot directory to start cleanly
rm -rf "$sysroot_dir"

# Find all .o files recursively in the source directory, ignoring stamp.o
object_files=$(find "$src_dir" -type f -name "*.o" ! \( -name "stamp.o" -o -name "argp-pvh.o" -o -name "repertoire.o" \))

# Add the lind_syscall.o file to the list of object files
object_files="$object_files $lind_syscall_path"

# Check if object files were found
if [ -z "$object_files" ]; then
  echo "No suitable .o files found in '$src_dir'."
  exit 1
fi

# Create the sysroot directory structure
mkdir -p "$sysroot_dir/include/wasm32-wasi" "$sysroot_dir/lib/wasm32-wasi"

# Pack all found .o files into a single .a archive
/home/wasi-sdk/build/llvm/bin/llvm-ar rcs "$output_archive" $object_files

# Check if llvm-ar succeeded
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Successfully created $output_archive with the following .o files:"
  echo "$object_files"
else
  echo "Failed to create the archive."
  exit 1
fi

# Copy all files from the external include directory to the new sysroot include directory
cp -r "$include_source_dir"/* "$sysroot_dir/include/wasm32-wasi/"

# Copy the crt1.o file into the new sysroot lib directory
cp "$crt1_source_path" "$sysroot_dir/lib/wasm32-wasi/"
```
Note that the header files should be pre-generated using `make install`. The crt1.o should be pre-compiled from this simple C file (see the WASM compile doc as well). The main job of this script is to change "include_source_dir"(path to target file), "crt1_source_path"(path to crt1.o), "lind_syscall_path"(path to lind_syscall.o), and "Pack all found .o files into a single .a archive"(path to llvm-ar) into your own path. crt1.o and lind_syscall.o are in "lind_syscall" directory in glibc.

After modifying all the path talked on the above, try to run gen_sysroot.sh and see if it works
```
./gen_sysroot.sh
```

```
void _start() {
    main();
}
void __wasm_call_dtors() {}
void __wasi_proc_exit(unsigned int exit_code) {}
```
Here are some macros we need to twist:

- `src_dir`: the glibc `build` directory that contains all the WASM object files
- `include_source_dir`: the path to your pre-built headers
- `crt1_source_path`: path to your pre-built crt1.o
- `lind_syscall_path`: you also need to pre-compile `lind_syscall.o`, just like `crt1.o`, and the source file is under glibc/lind_syscall
- `sysroot_dir`: path to generate the sysroot at
- `output_archive`: the path to the generate the libc.a, should be align with `sysroot_dir`

 

## Running only the pre-processor

The pre-processing stage of the compiler expland all `#include` and all macros. Because recursive macros are so prevalent in glibc, sometimes you want to see the actual source file after epxansions, then you want to use the `-E` option of `clang`.

The easiest way is to copy the compiler command from the compile log and add a `-E`. If you want to run pre-prosessor on ALL files, then run the configure script again, but before compiling, add `-E` to `config.make` right after
